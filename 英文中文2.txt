Listen to a conversation between two students outside a university dining hall. Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? No, I guess not. Great. This is for a student council report. We want to find out what students think of the campus food service. The results will tell us what kind of changes to push for. I think everyone has pretty strong opinions about that. Yeah, that's one thing I found out already. Ok. First, how often do you eat in the cafeteria? Almost everyday? I've got a meal contract. And do you usually eat here in anderson hall? Yeah, I live next door and you mentioned that you have a meal contract. Is that right? Uh huh. For breakfast and dinner monday through saturday.

What's your general impression of the food here? Well, people complain a lot, but basically I think it's okay. The vegetables are usually overcooked. Well, I mean they have to feed hundreds of people here. You're not going to get something freshly prepared just for you. What if I just put down generally satisfactory would like more fresh vegetables? Okay. Sure. So you think the other things like soup and dessert are? Okay? Yeah, that's about right. Is there anything you'd like to change about the cafeteria? The hours? Sometimes it's a real rush for me to get back here before six thirty.



聆听大学食堂外的两名学生之间的对话。劳驾。你介意我问你几个问题吗？不，我猜不是。大。这是学生会议报告。我们想了解学生对校园食品服务的看法。结果将告诉我们推动什么样的变化。我想每个人都有很强烈的意见。是的，这是我发现的一件事。好。首先，你经常在自助餐厅吃饭？几乎每天？我有一顿饭合同。你经常在安德森大厅吃饭吗？是的，我住在隔壁，你提到你吃饭了。是对的吗？嗯。周一至周六的早餐和晚餐。

你对这里的食物总体印象如何？好吧，人们抱怨很多，但基本上我觉得没关系。蔬菜通常是煮熟的。嗯，我的意思是他们必须在这里养活数百人。你不会为你准备一些新鲜的东西。如果我只是放下普遍满意的想要更多的新鲜蔬菜怎么办？好的。当然。所以你认为其他的东西，如汤和甜点？好的？是的，这是正确的。关于自助餐厅你有什么想改变的吗？小时？有时候我真的很想在六点半之前回到这里。
